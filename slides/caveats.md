Stuff to bear in mind:

- <span class="arrow">☛</span> page gets reprocessed on every request (text/html only). It's cheap though, get over it. Workaround: HTTP 304.
- <span class="arrow">☛</span> may not solve all your problems by itself.
- <span class="arrow">☛</span> may have bugs even (imagine that). I'll fix them if you report it though.
- <span class="arrow">☛</span> filters are being added as I need them. Feel free to send over those too.
